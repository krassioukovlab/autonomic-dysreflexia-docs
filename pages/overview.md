Welcome to an evidence-based app with information for EM physicians in the acute management of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). 

AD is a sudden 20 to 40 mmHg increase in blood pressure above baseline in response to a noxious or non-noxious stimulus below the level of the SCI which can lead to stroke and cardiovascular arrest.

The differential diagnosis is broad, including unrelated causes of hypertension.

### Causes & Triggers

#### Urinary Tract

* Bladder / Urethra: indwelling and blocked catheter, urethral strictures (resulting in bladder distension), detrusor overactivity
* Urinary Tract Infections, Cystitis, pyelonephritis
* Renal stones
* Diagnostic Interventions (e.g. urodynamics, cystoscopy, shock-wave lithotripsy)
* Trauma: testicular torsion, scrotal compression

#### GI Tract

* Bowel distension: constipation, flatulence, impaction, ileus
* Infections / Inflammation: Appendicitis, cholelithiasis Â± cholecystitis, inflammatory bowel disease, esophagitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, ulceration (e.g. H. pylori)
* Hemorrhoids
* Post-surgery

#### Skin, activity, attire

* **Skin**: Pressure ulcers, ingrown toenails, dermatitis, venous/arterial ulcer, microangiopathy necrosis, trauma (e.g. burns, lacerations). (Rare: Toxic shock syndrome)
* **Attire**: Tight belt, tight shoelaces, tight clothing
* **Sexual Activity:** genital stimulation, STIs, orgasm, ejaculation, trauma (e.g. priapism, penile fracture)
* **Reproductive System:** menstruation, endometriosis, pregnancy (uterine contractions, labour and delivery)
* ... and other conditions causing **pain** or sympathetic arousal (e.g. anxiety, fractures, sexual intercourse, sunburns etc.)

### Other causes of hypertension

The causes of hypertension can be exacerbated in an individual with SCI due to loss of control over the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system below the level of the injury.

Other causes of hypertension, in the right individual include:

* Previously listed ife threatening neurologic/cardiovascular causes (see **primer**)
* Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema
* Preeclampsia/Eclampsia
* Scleroderma renal crisis
* Acute glomerulonephritis
* Volume overload
* Drug use or overdose (e.g stimulants, especially alcohol, cocaine, or Synthroid)
* Renal Artery Stenosis
* Nephritic and nephrotic syndrome
